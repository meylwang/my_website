          <p class="intro-paragraph">Drag is increasingly breaking into the mainstream, with Rupaul’s Drag Race becoming popular fare and the most famous queens reaching stardom. Despite this growing recognition, I’ve anecdotally noticed that queens are viewed one-dimensionally - as eccentric, and perhaps crazy, people.<br>‍<br>What I found deconstructed our outsider assumptions of drag queens. The stories I heard about each queen’s childhood, process of getting into drag, approach to drag performance, and life out of drag led me to understandings of how queens use drag to <span class="emphasis text-span-2">decrease vulnerability</span> and <span class="emphasis text-span">deal with misperception</span>.<br> </p>

For this immersion, we attended a drag performance at a San Francisco club in drag, talking with the queens backstage, initiating conversations with 10-15 strangers with our drag personas, and dancing.<br></p>
