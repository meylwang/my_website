          <p class="intro-paragraph">Current art consumption culture detaches viewers from the art itself, viewed at a distance in formal and uninviting galleries. Through this art piece, I wanted to create a unique space where viewers felt uniquely connected to me, the artist, the forms captured in the space, as well as their own form and agency to affect change within the art piece. Photogrammetry combined with physical controls and interactions create an inseparable blend of the digital and physical. The impact of these piece is best described by the people who experienced it...<br><br><span class="quotes">&quot;Once the headset was on and I felt alone in the space, I was overcome with a feeling that I can only compare to reading my sister’s diary when I was a little girl.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The emotional takeaway of feeling like I was entering into the creative part of your brain itself I think can only be compared to what it would be like to enter into someone else’s memory.&quot;<br><br>&quot; When I was able to take on the role as master of time , I was no longer a mere visitor of the space, I was intertwined with the process of creation and destruction.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was impacting the space -- a part of me instead felt that the clock was allowing me to see layers of it that were previously unknown to me. I was still a viewer but I had autonomy over what I was seeing, and I that is a lot more interesting.&quot;</span></p>

      <p class="paragraph white">Viewers enter a small room with wall to wall figure drawings and physical objects displayed with a “Please do not touch” sign. Viewers can then put on the headset to see they are in the same room that has become slightly blurred and altered space. The please do not touch sign has become a “Please DO touch” plaque that prompts users to pick up the clock and turn the gear. As the hands spin back in time, the drawings on the walls slowly disintegrate, leaving blank spaces where figures used to be. Viewers feel a sense of loss and try to retrieve the drawings when small gestural figures start appearing in the space around them. The user cannot affect these figures as they interact with each other and them, making them individual beings. </p>
